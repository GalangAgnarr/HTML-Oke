Saya juga memiliki tim sepak bola favorit yaitu fc bayern munchen, sudah dari saya brojol saya cinta bayern munchen.

Nahh untuk Goat saya yaitu Cristiano Ronaldo siuuuuu, sudahh jelas bos kualitas nya diatas messi. Kemera wowo kemera wowo hahaha. Mungkin saya akan menambahkan lirik salah satu lagu favorit saya yaitu WHERE WE ARE: Remember when we would stay out too late
            We were young, havin' fun, made mistakes
            Did we ever know? Did we ever know?
            Did we ever know? Yeah
            All the things we'd just think of and say
            Never wrong, always right, not afraid
            Did we ever know? Did we ever know?
            Did we ever know? Is it all inside of my head?
            Maybe you still think I don't care
            But all I need is you
            Yeah, you know it's true, yeah, you know it's true Forget about where we are and let go
            We're so close
            If you don't know where to start, just hold on
            And don't run, no
            We're looking back, we messed around
            But that was then and this is now
            All we need's enough love to hold us
            Where we are Summer days rushin' by you and me
            Makes it harder to see underneath
            Did we ever know? Did we ever know?
            Did we ever know? (Did we ever know?) Is it all inside of my head?
            Maybe you still think I don't care
            But all I need is you
            Yeah, you know it's true, yeah, you know it's true Forget about where we are and let go
            We're so close
            If you don't know where to start, just hold on
            And don't run, no
            We're looking back, we messed around
            But that was then and this is now
            All we need's enough love to hold us
            Where we are But that was then and this is now
            All we need is enough love to hold us
            Where we are Where we are, where we are
            Where we are, where we are With closed eyes and open mind
            We can be there, we can be there
            But this time, let's cross the line
            Can you see it? Can you see it? Forget about where we are and let go
            We're so close (If you don't know)
            If you don't know where to start, just hold on
            And don't run, no (And don't run, no)
            We're looking back, we messed around
            But that was then and this is now (But that was then and this is now)
            All we need's enough love to hold us (To hold us)
            Where we are </p>
